# copilot-session-tui

A terminal user interface for managing GitHub Copilot CLI sessions. Browse, search, filter, rename, and resume sessions — all from a lightweight TUI that works over SSH.

## Features

- **Full session list** — see ALL your Copilot sessions with virtual scrolling
- **Project filter** — filter sessions by working directory (auto-detects current project)
- **Fuzzy search** — find sessions by name, project, or ID
- **Session details** — preview edited files, last message, and session stats
- **Resume** — press Enter to launch `copilot --resume` directly
- **Isolated sessions** — press `N` to create a branch-backed Git worktree before launching Copilot
- **Rename** — rename sessions inline with `r`
- **Safe cleanup** — delete TUI-created worktrees with dirty-worktree and unmerged-branch protection
- **Self-update** — checks GitHub Releases in the background and installs updates from the TUI
- **Sort** — cycle through sort orders (last used, created, name, project)
- **Active detection** — see which sessions are currently in use

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.70+
- [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Windows) or GCC (Linux/macOS)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd copilot-session-tui
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/copilot-session-tui` (or `.exe` on Windows).

### Updates

The TUI checks GitHub Releases for a newer version at startup, using a 12-hour cache.
When an update is available, the status bar shows the current and latest versions.
Press `u` to download and install the matching release asset, then restart the TUI.

### Usage

```bash
# Run in any Git project — auto-filters to that project, even if it has no sessions yet
copilot-session-tui

# Run without auto-filter to see all sessions
copilot-session-tui --auto-filter false

# Use a custom copilot config directory
copilot-session-tui --copilot-home /path/to/.copilot
```

### Shell integration (auto-cd into project directory)

When you resume or start a session through the TUI, the copilot subprocess runs in the correct project directory. However, after it exits, your shell returns to wherever you originally launched `copilot-session-tui` — this is a limitation of how processes work (a child process cannot change its parent's working directory).

To automatically `cd` into the project directory after exiting, add this to your shell config:

**Bash** (`~/.bashrc`):
```bash
eval "$(copilot-session-tui init bash)"
```

**Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
```bash
eval "$(copilot-session-tui init zsh)"
```

**PowerShell** (`$PROFILE`):
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (copilot-session-tui init powershell | Out-String)
```

This creates a `cst` function. Use `cst` instead of `copilot-session-tui` and your shell will auto-cd into the project directory after exiting a session.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑/k` `↓/j` | Navigate sessions |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to first/last |
| `Enter` | Resume selected session |
| `n` | New session in the filtered project (or the current directory's project) |
| `N` | New isolated worktree session with an editable branch name |
| `r` | Rename session |
| `d` | Delete session (with confirmation) |
| `/` | Fuzzy search |
| `f` / `p` | Filter by project |
| `c` | Clear project filter |
| `s` | Cycle sort order |
| `,` | Edit global settings |
| `.` | Edit filtered-project `.cst.json` settings |
| `u` | Install an available update |
| `?` | Show help |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force quit |

## How It Works

The TUI reads session data directly from `~/.copilot/session-state/` (or `COPILOT_HOME`):

- **`workspace.yaml`** — session metadata (ID, working directory, title, timestamps)
- **`events.jsonl`** — event log (parsed on-demand for edited files and messages)
- **`inuse.*.lock`** — lock files used to detect active sessions

When you resume a session, the TUI exits cleanly and launches `copilot --resume=<session-id>`.

## Isolated Worktree Sessions

Filter to a project and press uppercase `N`. The branch editor is prepopulated with
`copilot/<timestamp>` (or the configured prefix). CST validates the name with Git,
creates a short collision-resistant path, copies configured ignored files, and launches
Copilot with both its process directory and shell auto-`cd` target set to that worktree.

New branches start from the cached `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`. If that reference is not
available, CST uses the filtered project's current `HEAD` and prints a notice before
Copilot starts.

The default worktree root is the platform local-data directory under `cst/wt` (for
example, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cst\wt` on Windows). Generated repository and branch
components are bounded, filesystem-safe, and include short hashes to avoid collisions.

### Configuration

Press `,` for global settings. Existing global files containing only `yolo`, `model`,
and `reasoning_effort` remain valid. Worktree defaults are stored in the same config:

```json
{
  "yolo": false,
  "worktree": {
    "branch_prefix": "copilot/",
    "root": "D:\\cst-wt"
  }
}
```

Press `.` while a project filter is active to edit repository-root `.cst.json`.
Each field explicitly shows `Inherited` or `Override`; `Space` toggles that state.
Project settings take precedence over global settings, which take precedence over
built-in defaults:

```json
{
  "worktree": {
    "branch_prefix": "feature/",
    "root": ".worktrees"
  }
}
```

A relative global root is resolved from the global config directory. A relative
project root override is resolved from the repository root. Invalid project JSON is
reported and is never silently overwritten.

### `.worktreeinclude`

CST implements Claude Code's `.worktreeinclude` convention. Put the file at the
repository root and use gitignore syntax, including directory patterns and `!`
negation:

```gitignore
.env
.env.local
cache/
!cache/large/
```

Only files that both match `.worktreeinclude` and are reported by Git as ignored are
copied. Tracked files are never copied, and relative directory structure is preserved.
If copying fails, CST rolls back the new worktree and branch before launching Copilot.

### Cleanup and ownership

CST atomically records only worktrees it creates in an app-data registry and prunes
entries whose paths no longer exist. Manually created worktrees and ordinary sessions
remain session-only during deletion.

Deleting a registered session explicitly removes its worktree first. Dirty worktrees
require a second `Shift+Y` force confirmation. CST then attempts `git branch -d`; an
unmerged branch is preserved and reported, and CST never escalates automatically to
`git branch -D`. Active sessions cannot be deleted.
