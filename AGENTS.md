# Working on CST as an agent

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository. Humans should read
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, which this does not repeat in full.

## Do not commit to `main`

Work on a branch and open a pull request, even for a one-line fix. If you were asked to
"commit" something, that means committing to a branch and opening a PR unless the person
explicitly said to push to `main`.

PRs are merged with **merge commits, not squash**, because the release notes are built
from individual commit messages.

## Commit messages are the changelog's source material

This repository has unusually long commit messages, and that is on purpose. Release notes
are generated from `git log --no-merges <last-tag>..HEAD`, so a message that only restates
the diff produces a useless changelog entry.

Write the **why**: what was wrong, what you ruled out, what you decided and what it cost.
Subject line is `type: imperative effect` — `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`,
or `test`. Describe the effect on someone using CST, not the mechanism.

Do not add an `Unreleased` section to `CHANGELOG.md`. It is written at release time by
`.claude/skills/release`.

## Before you say you are done

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo test
```

All three must pass. Clippy carries three pre-existing warnings; anything beyond those is
yours. Do not report work as complete without running these — and report the real result,
including failures.

## Conventions that are enforced, not merely preferred

- **Tests** live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of the file they test, and are
  named as full sentences stating the behaviour and why it matters.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` format** is checked by a test in `src/changelog.rs`. It must stay flat
  `- ` bullets under `## vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` headings, with no inline markdown at all —
  CST renders it as plain text, so backticks and links show up literally.
- **Comments explain why, not what.** A comment restating the line below it will be
  removed in review.

## If you are working on `src/threads/`

Two rules there are security properties, not preferences, and both are held up by tests
that name them. If a change makes one of those tests fail, the change is wrong.

- **A wake-up carries a link and never comment text.** Comment bodies are written by
  anyone who can reach the thread, and a session may be running with `--yolo` in a real
  repository. `threads::judge` is the single exception and pays for it: no tools, no
  repository, an empty working directory.
- **A comment from a login that is not ours never starts anything.** It becomes a pending
  item for the user. Every CST agent posts as the same account, so a different author is
  by definition somebody outside.

Nothing in `src/threads/` may mark a GitHub notification as read. That inbox is the
user's own and shared with their browser; the `Last-Modified` cursor exists so we never
have to touch it.

## Useful context

- `cargo run -- doctor` reports the state of every external dependency; run it after
  touching session launching, `gh`, `git`, or config loading.
- `vendor/edtui` is a vendored dependency with local patches. Changes there are
  deliberate; read the surrounding comments before altering them.
- The repository is a Copilot CLI session manager, so it is often run *inside* one of its
  own sessions. Be careful with anything that kills processes or rewrites config.
