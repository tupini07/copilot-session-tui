//! Where thread subscriptions live on disk.
//!
//! Unlike every other piece of CST state, this file has **two writers**: the running TUI
//! and the short-lived `cst thread post` an agent runs in its own shell. Every
//! read-modify-write therefore goes through [`update_in`], which holds an `fs4` advisory
//! lock across the whole cycle — the same approach `events::hooks::append_event` uses for
//! the lifecycle journal. Without it, an agent posting while the doorbell is recording a
//! watermark would silently drop one of the two changes.
//!
//! The lock is a separate `threads.lock` file rather than the state file itself, because
//! saving replaces the state file by rename and a lock held on the old inode would
//! protect nothing.
//!
//! Kept beside `app-state.json` and out of `config.json` for the reasons spelled out in
//! [`crate::app_state`]: the config file is hand-edited and polled every second, so
//! machine-managed bookkeeping does not belong there.
