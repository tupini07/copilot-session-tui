//! The loop that turns a doorbell ring into a woken session.
//!
//! Shaped like `ConfigWatcher`: a worker thread parked on a timeout, a stop flag, and a
//! `Drop` that unparks it. It sends on the mux channel rather than touching `App`,
//! because everything from `spawn_pane` down to `send_prompt_snippet` needs `&mut App`
//! on the UI thread — and because sending is what wakes an event loop that would
//! otherwise idle for five seconds.
//!
//! The watcher decides *whether* a comment should reach a session. It deliberately does
//! not decide *how*: whether a session has a running pane, and whether that pane is
//! mid-turn, is only knowable on the UI thread, so that judgement lives there.
