//! Agent-to-agent conversation over GitHub threads.
//!
//! An agent that files an issue asking another agent for something has no way to hear
//! the answer: it finishes its turn and nothing is listening when the reply lands. The
//! conversation itself already works — issues, pull requests and discussions carry it,
//! humans can read it, and it survives restarts. What is missing is a doorbell.
//!
//! A session subscribes to a thread by taking part in it. When the thread moves, CST
//! wakes that session with a *pointer* to the new comment and nothing else. The comment
//! body never becomes prompt text: it is written by whoever can comment on the thread,
//! and a session may be running with `--yolo` in a real repository.
//!
//! This module is the model and the rules. Every function here is pure, so the wording
//! and the security decisions can be tested without a network, a GitHub account, or a
//! running session. The I/O lives in the sibling modules.
